## How It Works

WebMD uses a diagnostic approach to convert web content:

1. **Initial Diagnosis**: Examines the page using Mozilla's Readability.js
2. **Content Extraction**: Surgically removes the main content from surrounding clutter
3. **Emergency Fallback**: For non-article pages, performs full-page conversion
4. **Treatment**: Applies Turndown.js with GitHub Flavored Markdown for the cure

## Configuration

Access settings through the extension popup:

- **Use Readability for articles**: Enable/disable article extraction
- **Include metadata**: Add YAML frontmatter with page metadata
- **Auto-copy to clipboard**: Automatically copy result when conversion completes

## Technical Details
